Hey, my name is **Alexey Kondratov**. I'm originally from Moscow, Russia, where I grew up, got my Master's degree in physics, defended my PhD, and [spent several years doing academic research](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=WXJo9l0AAAAJ). After that, I participated in [2017 GSoC for the PostgreSQL organization](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2017/projects/6196688620355584) and finally decided to switch tracks in my career and focus on software development.

Nowadays, I live in Berlin, Germany, and work as a Lead Software Engineer at <https://neon.tech>, working on the compute part of serverless Postgres.
