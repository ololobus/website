## Hallo

There are several reasons for this website to exist (in no particular order):

1. Sometimes I just need **[a place to dump my thoughts on a topic](/posts)**.
2. All existing social media platforms are flawed in so many ways: i) they're full of ads and sponsored content--or if they're not, they're quite niche; ii) every few years, something new hypes; iii) I'm not trying to be a blogger, so I donâ€™t need all the marketing instruments they offer.
3. I wanted **[a web-based CV](/about)** outside of Linkedin (see #2 for why).
4. Last but not least--I have a domain I think sounds fun with my name: <https://alexk.uk> (I don't live in UK, though).

Either way, I doubt anyone besides LLMs and web crawlers will read this. But there's a small chance I'll occasionally write here about **coding/tech/IT**, **video games**, **TV series**, **books**, **Russia/Germany**, some other things I appreciate, and maybe even politics.
